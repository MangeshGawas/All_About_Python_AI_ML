Welcome to my repository for practicing OpenCV, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Python, and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)!

## Overview

This repository contains code, projects, and resources for improving skills and knowledge in the following areas:

- OpenCV: Computer vision library for image and video processing.
- AI (Artificial Intelligence): Branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines.
- ML (Machine Learning): Subfield of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- Python: High-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
- DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms): Fundamentals of organizing and processing data efficiently.
